# A Path Following AI

This is a demonstration of an artificially intelligent robot with two wheels that learns how to move on the 2D plane by sending commands to its two wheels and studying the resulting change in position. The execution of motor commands is simulated using basic geometric calculations making use of constants such as wheel diameter. 

Using this learning process, the robot can theoretically perform any movement on the 2D plane, even those it did not specifically learn before. 

## Development 

Run `npm run docs` to generate fresh documentation in the `docs/` folder.   
Don't forget to `npm install -g typedocs` to make this work.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

# Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

# Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

# Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
